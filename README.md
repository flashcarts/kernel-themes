# Flashcart Kernel Themes Index

This site is a download repository for flashcart kernel themes. Currently, the site is hosting AKMenu/WoodR4 themes, but more kernels will be added soon.

<https://themes.flashcarts.net>

### Building the site locally

1. Install [Ruby 3.x](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) for your machine
1. Run `bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle` to ensure that dependency versions do not clash with other ruby projects
1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
    - This will build the site to `_site`, and host a simple web server at `127.0.0.1:4000`
