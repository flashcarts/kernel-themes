### Site Status
---

#### [6/11/2025]

- [ShaolinAssassin YSMenu themes](https://www.deviantart.com/shaolinassassin/gallery/27116814/ysmenu-skins) have been added to the repository.

#### [2/19/2025]

- Initial YSMenu support has been added, and the YSMenu page now hosts the stock themes YSMenu ships with. More themes will be added soon!

- Some more AKMenu themes have been tagged and had authors updated. Not all of them are tagged just yet.

- Help is appreciated! If you would like to add a theme to the website, please fork the repo and create a pull request. Theme screenshots are captured by emulating an R4 with melonDS 1.0-RC.

#### [1/21/2025]

- Currently, the site only hosts WoodR4 themes, YSMenu themes will be added soon. R4iMenu support is planned.

- Not all themes are properly tagged if they were added recently. Themes with "Unknown" authors are untagged. I work on tagging them when I have time.

- Themes that have no author listed are themes that I have tagged, but don't know who made them. If you know or are the author of such a theme, please contact me by email: `sanras[at]flashcarts(dot)net`
