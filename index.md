### Site Status
---
#### [10/30/2025]

- YSMenu themes from NDSThemes.com with author usernames Q-Z have been processed and uploaded. This wraps up the collection of YSMenu themes from NDSThemes.com, at least the ones that are recoverable from Internet Archive. I will continue to update the repo with other YSMenu themes if I come across them on other sources.
- Going forward, Moonshell 2 theme support is planned, and more AKMenu themes will be uploaded, as there is still a large backlog of those waiting to be processed.

#### [10/29/2025]

- YSMenu themes from NDSThemes.com with author usernames G-P have been processed and uploaded.
- Website dark mode has been updated to fix color inconsistencies when the site defaults to dark theme rather than being manually selected.

#### [10/3/2025]

- YSMenu themes from NDSThemes.com are now being uploaded to the repository. Currently, themes from authors with usernames A-F have been processed and uploaded.
- The menu select tiles above have been updated to be dynamic, and will now resize and recolor text to properly support both white and dark theme users.
- More AKMenu themes will be tagged and uploaded in the future as well, once I am finished working through the YSMenu theme backlog.

#### [6/11/2025]

- [ShaolinAssassin YSMenu themes](https://www.deviantart.com/shaolinassassin/gallery/27116814/ysmenu-skins) have been added to the repository.

#### [2/19/2025]

- Initial YSMenu support has been added, and the YSMenu page now hosts the stock themes YSMenu ships with. More themes will be added soon!
- Some more AKMenu themes have been tagged and had authors updated. Not all of them are tagged just yet.
- Help is appreciated! If you would like to add a theme to the website, please fork the repo and create a pull request. Theme screenshots are captured by emulating an R4 with melonDS 1.0-RC.

#### [1/21/2025]

- Currently, the site only hosts WoodR4 themes, YSMenu themes will be added soon. R4iMenu support is planned.
- Not all themes are properly tagged if they were added recently. Themes with "Unknown" authors are untagged. I work on tagging them when I have time.
- Themes that have no author listed are themes that I have tagged, but don't know who made them. If you know or are the author of such a theme, please contact me by email: `sanras[at]flashcarts(dot)net`
